                I am in my third year at Wayne State University, pursuing a BSCS with a minor in Mathematics.  I hope to get an internship 
                and then a job as a Software Engineer, but there are so many possibilities with Computer Science that I'm excited to learn and explore.
                In my free time, I make music and am currently learning to produce music. I also enjoy creative writing and spending time exploring 
                different art forms!

                I am a senior in Computer Science at Wayne State University and hope to get a software engineer intern
                position before graduating. In my free time, I like to workout, watch soccer (Chelsea fan), 
                listen to audiobooks, and play Warzone.

                I am a senior pursuing a BSCS degree at Wayne State University, and I hope to put that degree to work as
                a software engineer in the future.
                In my limited free time, I enjoy skateboarding, writing music, playing guitar (13 years!), photography,
                and drawing.

            <figcaption>
                I am a senior at Wayne State University studying computer science, interested in cyber security. Iâ€™m originally 
                from Texas, moved here about 2 years ago, and I really must say I love Michigan. Some of my hobbies are reading, 
                listening to podcasts, my favorites are about solved murders or criminals, I really enjoy doing things outdoors, 
                and of course playing video games.

                I'm Nnamdi, a Computer Science major with an insatiable drive for building and engineering things. I am
                a huge robotics nerd who likes to tinker with electronics and program stuff.
                Through my time in college I have founded and managed the University's robotics club, partaken in
                undergraduate research, and helped grad students work on various software/hardware related issues.
                Thank you for stopping by!
